    #' HP-PPIs with Unknown Class Labels
    #' @description This dataset consists of interactions between
    #' SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, achieved by AP-MS
    #' (affinity purification mass spectrometry).
    #' @details
    #' To construct this dataset, data (supplementary table 1) containing
    #' SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs was retrieved from (Gordon et al., 2020) and 700
    #' pairs were randomly selected from total pairs, followed by converting
    #' protein sequences of host or viral proteins to numerical features and
    #' finally concatenating the computed features in order to construct
    #' host-pathogen PPIs.

    #' @format A data.frame containing 700 SARS-CoV-2-Human protein-protein
    #' interactions (PPIs) with pre-computed numerical features using
    #' CTD (composition/transition/distribution) descriptors.
