\title{HP-PPIs with Unknown Class Labels}
\format{

interactions (PPIs) with pre-computed numerical features using
CTD (composition/transition/distribution) descriptors.

\description{
This dataset consists of interactions between
SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, achieved by AP-MS
(affinity purification mass spectrometry).
}
\details{
To construct this dataset, data (supplementary table 1) containing
SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs was retrieved from (Gordon et al., 2020) and 700
pairs were randomly selected from total pairs, followed by converting
protein sequences of host or viral proteins to numerical features and
finally concatenating the computed features in order to construct
host-pathogen PPIs.
